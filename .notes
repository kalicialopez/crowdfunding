- Create a campaign page throwing error when not logged in (need to create a new page asking users to login OR create an account, for this)
- redirect needed when someone logs in, back to the homepage.

- unable to remove default link styling (color, underline) on nav bar and project card link
  -- this issue is temporarily solved using a:-webkit-any-link { text-decoration: none !important; }
